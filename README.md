## 🌟 Features

* **Continuous, Low-Latency Recognition**: Real-time transcription with minimal delay.
* **Event-Driven API**: Receive callbacks for recognized phrases, errors, and state changes.
* **UTF-8 & Multi-Language Support**: Leverage SAPI’s language packs for international applications.
* **Thread-Safe**: Safe to use across multiple threads in your application.
* **Console & GUI Samples**: Reference implementations to get started instantly.

---

## 🏗️ Architecture

The library is organized into three layers:

1. **Core**: Wraps Windows Speech API (SAPI) with `SpeechRecognizer` class.
2. **Examples**:

   * `TestASR`: Console interface.
   * `Windows-ASR`: GUI sample using Win32/MFC.
3. **Documentation & Assets**: UML diagrams, API specs in `docs/`.

> **Diagram**: See `docs/architecture.png` for a visual overview.

---

## ⚙️ Prerequisites

* **OS**: Windows 7 or later
* **IDE**: Visual Studio 2015+ (Desktop C++ workload)
* **SDKs**:

  * Windows SDK 10.x or later
  * Windows Speech Platform SDK (for additional languages)
* **Language Standard**: C++17 support

---

## 🚀 Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bookbot-kids/windows-asr.git
cd windows-asr
# Open windows-asr.sln in Visual Studio
```

1. Configure project include/lib paths to point at your Windows SDK & Speech Platform SDK.
2. Select **Release** (or **Debug**) and **Build Solution**.

---

## 💻 Usage

### Console Demo (TestASR)

```powershell
cd TestASR\bin\Release
TestASR.exe
```

Speak into your default microphone; recognized text prints in real time.

### GUI Demo (Windows-ASR)

```powershell
cd windows-asr\bin\Release
Windows-ASR.exe
```

Interact with a simple UI to start/stop recognition and view transcripts.

## 📚 API Reference

```cpp
#include "SpeechRecognizer.h"

int main() {
    SpeechRecognizer recognizer;
    recognizer.Initialize();
    recognizer.StartRecognition();

    // Attach event handlers
    recognizer.OnRecognized([](const std::string &text) {
        std::cout << "Recognized: " << text << std::endl;
    });

    // Keep the app running until user exit
    std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::minutes(5));

    recognizer.StopRecognition();
}
```

* **Initialize()**: Prepare the recognizer and load grammars.
* **StartRecognition() / StopRecognition()**: Control ASR engine.
* **OnRecognized(callback)**: Register callback for recognized text.

Detailed class and method docs in [`docs/API.md`](docs/API.md).

---

## 🛠️ Extending the Library

* **Custom Grammars**: Load XML grammar files via `LoadGrammarFromFile(path)`.
* **Audio Input**: Integrate custom audio streams by subclassing `IAudioStream`.
* **Threading Models**: Use your own message loop or integrate with GUI frameworks.

---

## 📝 Roadmap

* [ ] Grammar-based command parsing module
* [ ] Microphone selection & audio device settings
* [ ] Support for cloud-based ASR fallback
* [ ] Performance optimizations for large vocabularies
